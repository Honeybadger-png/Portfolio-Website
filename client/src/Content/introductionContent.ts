    shortBrief:{
        en: "I am currently a computer engineering student at Karabuk University. I seek to build beautiful, efficient, helpful projects with my creativity, and my skills. I enjoy coding for frontend using React, Three.js and some other useful libraries and frameworks. Basically, I can use whichever tool, or technology that is useful, efficient to finish the product. I love video games and I enjoyed 3D art for couple of years but I used it like a hobby. I like to create fan arts trying to make the characters that I have seen from movies. It is more like a therapy for me to sculpt in blender so you can see my 3D projects too. I want to find an entry level job and be useful to my environment.",
