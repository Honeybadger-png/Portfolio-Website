                        Hi! You probably already know my name, so instead of a boring "about me," 
                        here's my story in short. I first discovered computers around the age of 7, 
                        thanks to my neighbor. At first I just watched others play, until I finally 
                        got the chance myself. A few years later, my family got our own PC, and from 
                        then on I was hooked.

                    <p>
                        I wrote my first HTML in high school with the help of a geeky friend, but I 
                        didn't dive deeper until university, where I chose Computer Engineering. I'm 
                        not the type who codes 24/7, but I've always had ideas I want to build—mostly 
                        around the web and video games. My dream project back then was a social media 
                        platform for nerds, and that's what pushed me toward web development. I've 
                        worked on both frontend and backend, and I enjoy learning every part of the process.

                        Right now, I'm in the early stage of my career, actively looking for 
                        internships or junior roles. While I haven't found the right role yet, the 
                        journey has taught me resilience, patience, and the importance of being 
                        proactive and social. I've seen the bottom—now there's only one way to go: up.
